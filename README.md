# Surface_Roughness
A sata science project focused on analyzing and predicting surface roughness. The goal is to provide tools for data processing, model training, and visualization to better understand the characteristics of different surfaces.
  Project Goals

## The primary objectives of this project are:

 - To explore and analyze a dataset of manufacturing process parameters and corresponding surface roughness measurements.
   
 - To develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting surface finish.
   
 - To identify the key input parameters that have the most significant impact on the final surface finish.
   
 - To provide a clear, reproducible workflow for others to follow or build upon.



## The project follows a standard data science workflow:

- Data Cleaning:  Clean Data, Data formatting, handle missing valuesand outliers.
  
- Exploratory Data Analysis : Perform Data Analysis to understand the relationships between different parameters.
  
- Model Building: Various machine learning algorithms are trained and tuned.
  
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated Machine Learning Models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error and R2 score on a test set.
  
- Results and Insights: Provide actionable insights based on the best performing model.


## The project is built using Python and several key libraries

- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  
- scikit-learn: The primary library for machine learning model development.
  
- matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.
  
- numpy: For numerical operations.
  
 - jupyter lab: Used for exploratory data analysis and build model.
